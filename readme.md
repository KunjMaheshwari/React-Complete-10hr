# Important Points to remember

1. npm -> npm stands for node package manager, it allows you to install javascript library.

2. npx -> node package executer, which directly executes the libraries.

3. "npx create-react-app" -> install the dependencies for us whereas on the other hand the "npm create vite@latest" do not install the dependencies for you, manually we need to install them.

4. what is linting? -> Linting is the process of analyzing code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and other issues that could affect the functionality or readability of the code.
Example - ESLint: Used primarily for JavaScript and TypeScript.

5. Build command -> When you deploy your application on vercel or netlify, react runs the "npm run build" command.

6. robots.txt is for your google indexing and manifest.json is for your mobile indexing.
