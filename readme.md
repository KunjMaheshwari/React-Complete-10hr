# Important Points to remember

1. npm -> npm stands for node package manager, it allows you to install javascript library.

2. npx -> node package executer, which directly executes the libraries.

3. "npx create-react-app" -> install the dependencies for us whereas on the other hand the "npm create vite@latest" do not install the dependencies for you, manually we need to install them.

4. what is linting? -> Linting is the process of analyzing code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and other issues that could affect the functionality or readability of the code.
Example - ESLint: Used primarily for JavaScript and TypeScript.

5. Build command -> When you deploy your application on vercel or netlify, react runs the "npm run build" command.

6. robots.txt is for your google indexing and manifest.json is for your mobile indexing.

7. State -> Any change in the state will re render the UI on the web page.

8. Batching -> React never sends anything immediately, it first bundles all the changes then sends to the virtual DOM with the help of reconsilation. 

9. Difting -> Difting is a process in React.js in which React Compares the virtual DOM with the Actual DOM. 

10. Reconcillation -> It is a process through which react updates it's UI very quickly.

11. React Fiber -> React Fiber is a reimplementation of the React core algorithm, introduced to improve its performance and capabilities. 

12. Props -> These are the Objects therefore we can add Values inside it.

13. useCallback -> useCallback is a React hook that helps in optimizing the React functional components by memoizing callback functions.

14. Memoization -> It is a concept which is basically used with useCallBack functions in react.js and it is performed using the dependency array that we create at the end of useCallback function.

15. useEffect -> useEffect is a critical hook in React for managing side effects in functional components. It allows you to perform operations like data fetching, DOM manipulation

16. useId -> useId is used in React to add a unique ID.
