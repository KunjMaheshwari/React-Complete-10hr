# Important Points to remember
1. npm -> npm stands for node package manager, it allows you to install javascript library.
2. npx -> node package executer, which directly executes the libraries.
3. "npx create-react-app" -> install the dependencies for us whereas on the other hand the "npm create vite@latest" do not install the dependencies for you, manually we need to install them.
